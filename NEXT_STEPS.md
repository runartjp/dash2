# Next Steps - Projects & Tasks Permission Setup

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Projects & Tasks collections created in Directus
- Database relations configured (owner, project, assignee)
- API routes implemented (10 endpoints - full CRUD)
- Frontend pages built (projects list, tasks list)
- Sidebar menu updated

⚠ **Remaining Issue:**
- Directus permissions not set for projects/tasks collections
- Causing 403 Forbidden errors when accessing pages

## Why Automatic Setup Failed

Directus 11 uses a policy-based permission system where permissions must be attached to policies. The admin user via API doesn't have permission to create/modify policies - this can only be done through the Directus Admin UI.

## Solution: Manual Permission Setup (5 minutes)

Follow the guide in `PERMISSIONS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to set up permissions through the Directus Admin UI:

1. **Access Admin Panel**
   - URL: http://localhost:8056/admin
   - Login: admin@example.com / dash2admin

2. **Navigate to Permissions**
   - Settings → Roles & Permissions → Administrator role

3. **Enable Permissions for Projects Collection**
   - Find "projects" in the collection list
   - Enable: ☑ Create, ☑ Read, ☑ Update, ☑ Delete
   - Set: All fields (`*`), No restrictions

4. **Enable Permissions for Tasks Collection**
   - Find "tasks" in the collection list
   - Enable: ☑ Create, ☑ Read, ☑ Update, ☑ Delete
   - Set: All fields (`*`), No restrictions

5. **Save and Test**
   - Click Save
   - Refresh http://localhost:3002/projects
   - Refresh http://localhost:3002/tasks
   - Both pages should now work!

## Verification Commands

After setting permissions, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check permissions are set
cd /home/user/projects/active/dash2
node check-permissions.js

# Should show permissions for projects and tasks collections
```

## Files Created

Setup scripts (attempted automated fix, not needed after manual setup):
- `setup-project-task-permissions.js` - First attempt
- `fix-permissions.js` - Second attempt
- `setup-permissions-api.js` - Third attempt
- `check-permissions.js` - Verification script (useful)

Documentation:
- `PERMISSIONS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed manual setup guide
- `PROJECT_TASK_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Technical specification
- `PROJECT_TASK_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation report
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This file

## After Permission Setup

Once permissions are set, you can:

1. **Create sample data** in Directus Admin:
   - Content → Projects → Create new project
   - Content → Tasks → Create new task

2. **View in frontend**:
   - http://localhost:3002/projects - See all projects
   - http://localhost:3002/tasks - See all tasks

3. **Future enhancements** (optional):
   - Project detail pages (`/projects/[id]`)
   - Task detail pages (`/tasks/[id]`)
   - Create/edit forms in frontend
   - Dashboard with statistics

## Summary

**The implementation is 95% complete.** The only missing piece is setting the Directus permissions through the Admin UI, which takes about 5 minutes.
